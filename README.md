# my books 2022

This project is part of my books newsletter "je lis trop". It is a continuously updated list of books I've read this year. People who read my newsletter are often curious what are my favorites (in other words, my top recommendations for them). I hid them in the gaps of this list so the site's user can find out my top reads in a more fun way. The website has a custom cursor which the user can click on and then move around the page to color it, revealing the hidden books.
